This is our course project.
And it looks the algorithm in this paper (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuanlong-Shao-2/publication/220072826_Laplacian_Regularized_Gaussian_Mixture_Model_for_Data_Clustering/links/02bfe5138f6f4d5344000000/Laplacian-Regularized-Gaussian-Mixture-Model-for-Data-Clustering.pdf) doesn't run as expected
